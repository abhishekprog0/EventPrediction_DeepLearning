## Event Prediction using Deep Learning

Certain Recurrent events could possibly have prediction power on the performance of equity or ETF. When certain events happen, the market could possibly price in or would catch the expectation and affect the market after the events. For example, based on the maro events calendar: https://tradingeconomics.com/ could we find the relationship between the market events/prediction and the performance of the related asset. The relationship could be used to do clustering, and the events could be used as predicting signal for the portfolio.  Currently, certain theme that we care about would be: gold, ESG, job growth, energy (https://www.eia.gov/), and also different kind of economic events showed in the trading economics calendar above.  (Factset provide an event calendar which contain events data for certain portfolio the user select.  Earning prediction is the most populate events used now.)
